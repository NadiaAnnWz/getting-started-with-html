<b><u> Nadia W.'s Notes</u></b> <p><u>Introduction</u><br>
-The web is used to access information by way of computers.<br>
-The user types a URL into their browser, or searches for one, which results in the computer communicating with servers by way of HTTP and the Internet.<br>
-The accessed information is in the form of webpages that contain HTML (hypertext markup language).</p>
<p><u>Aspects of HTML</u><br>
-Text: visible<br>
-Markup: how it is arranged<br>
-References to other documents: images and videos<br>
-Links to other pages.</p>
<p><u>Tags</u><br>
-What markup is made of: opening and closing tags<br>
-Example (no spaces) < tag name > content < / tag name ><br>
-A basic tag would be one to make text bold: (no spaces) < b > text < / b ></p>
<p><u>Tag Attributes</u><br>
-Used for images (src) and links (href)<br>
-Images do not have closing tags.  Here is an example of an image using an src attribute: <img src=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QJfGXFeAR1w/T9xVKyzb3kI/AAAAAAAAAFM/m7MINdzgzLo/s1600/blue+point+siamese.jpg alt=siamese!></br><br>
-Example of a link using a href attribute: <a href= "www.catfancy.com"> Cat Fancy!</a></p>
<p><u>Whitespace and Line Breaks</u><br>
-To create multiple lines, the tags used are for Breaks (br) and Paragraph (p)<br>
-Breaks are considered a 'Void Tag' meaning they do not have a closing tag.
<br>-Paragraphs require a closing tag.  Paragraph tags essentially create a 'box' in which the text is written, of which we will eventually learn to format the size.</p>
<p><u>Inline vs. Block Elements</u><br>
-Inline elements results in changes to a line of text. Tags include attribute, span, break, image, and strong.<br>
-Block elements format entire blocks of information. They include div, form, and paragraph.
